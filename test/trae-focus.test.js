/**
 * Guards what a second double-click on the shortcut does.
 *
 * Until now it did nothing at all when TRAE was already running: the CDP probe
 * passed, the panel was already injected, and the launcher exited without
 * touching a window. Three files have to agree for the fix to work — the process
 * module raises the window, the launcher decides when, and the daemon carries the
 * failure message back to the panel — and none of them can be exercised here, so
 * these assertions read the sources.
