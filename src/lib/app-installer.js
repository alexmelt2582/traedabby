/**
 * Downloads, verifies and finally runs the release installer.
 *
 * This is the only part of the program that executes a file it fetched from the
 * network, so the order is fixed and total: pick the asset by exact name (see
 * `selectInstallerAsset`), stream it into the temporary directory while hashing
 * it, compare the size and the sha256 against what the release advertised, and
 * only then start it. The checksum is the entire argument for running it.
 *
 * The download never lands in `data\`: that directory holds account snapshots,
 * and an installer is neither state nor something to keep. It goes to the
 * temporary directory instead, where leftovers are also thrown away — a leftover
 * is deleted on the next daemon start, because the process that downloaded it is
 * usually killed by that very installer. Until then a leftover that still matches
 * the release is reused rather than fetched again, which is what makes retrying
 * after a closed wizard free.

 * silently doing nothing. There is no console to hide either — the installer is
