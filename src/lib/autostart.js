 *    ANSI, so its source must stay pure ASCII. The project path is therefore
 *    never embedded; the script resolves it from its own location at runtime.
 *    VBScript has no backslash escape, so paths must not go through
 *    `JSON.stringify` (which would emit `\\` and corrupt them).
 * 2. The shortcut-creation PowerShell script is passed as a `-Command`
 *    argument, which travels as UTF-16 on the process command line. Non-ASCII
 *    paths are safe there and must not be ASCII-restricted.
 *
 * The `.lnk` file itself stores paths as UTF-16 through the COM API, so it is
 * the only artifact allowed to contain the non-ASCII project path.
