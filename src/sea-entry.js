/**
 * Entry point of the bundled single executable.
 *
 * The bundle contains the service CLI, the launcher, the daemon and the
 * watchdog. Which one runs is decided by an internal argv switch, because a
 * single executable cannot load sibling script files from disk.
 *
 * Without a switch the executable behaves exactly like `scripts/service.js`,
 * so `TraeEnhancer.exe status` and `node scripts/service.js status` agree. The
 * service CLI re-enters this executable with the launcher switch when it needs
 * to start TRAE, which keeps a single user-facing command surface.
 *
 * No top-level await: the bundle is emitted as CommonJS, which does not support
 * it, so the dynamic imports are wrapped in an async function.
